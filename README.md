## A little discord bot to play music in voice channels.
In order to use it for your own private uses:
1. first build the project https://github.com/Alphapcka-lgtm/YtMusicApi. Its a custom library to search for songs via YouTube Music. This is required to build the bot.
2. Added the library you've build as a library to the source of the bot.
3. Build the bot
4. After starting the application, it will create two .properties files in the current working directory. Configure these files.
5. Run it.

### Known Issues
- Playback errors on YouTube videos
- The way you have to build the project is currently quite shitty.
