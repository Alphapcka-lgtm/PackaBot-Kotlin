## A little discord bot to play music in voice channels.

In order to use it for your own private uses:

1. Either build the bot with gradle yourself or download the newest jar from the release.
2. Start the bot either, with the supplied bash file or by yourself via the by gradle build bash files in `bin`
3. An error will occur since the bot can not find any config files. The bot will create blueprints of the config file
   which the user will have to finish configure by themselves. (Database config is optional!)
4. Run the bot and enjoy.

### Known Issues
